# Do Sheet
A RPG Character Sheet generator.

The purpose of this project is to be a generator for Tabletop RPG systems. We will start with a simple character sheet from Vampire: The Masquerade and move on to other, mode complexes ones, like GURPS, D20 and so on.

## Pull requests are welcome!
If you have any great idea and want to discuss, please use the issues here at Github. Whenever ready to implement, send us a pull request!

## Features coming
* Be able to register as a user and have its profile at system/user

## Roadmap
